# LM2RENPY

A project that analyse LiveMaker (v3)'s project and conver to Ren'py. You just need a little manual work:

* Create a dictionary that convert all file's name to english
* Create another dictionary that convert all variable's name to english
* Finish Ren'py game menu and styles by your own
* Include LiveMaker Support Library for Ren'py (will be published in the near future)

Then you can use this algorithm to convert you LiveMaker project to Ren'py.

Attention: I create this repository for the purpose to convert SCHOOLBOYS! AYUMI, which means some part of the algorithm is not suitable for other LivaMaker project. You must change some detail of the algorithm to suit your own one.
